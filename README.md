## Work Experience
**Data Scientist II @ Afiniti (_February 2022 - Present_)**
- Led a team with 4 direct reports, generating $10 million in additional value for our client, Telefonica Spain
- Built a pipeline to predict lagged metrics using Neural Networks and gradient-boosting algorithms
    - Models forecasted 90-day revenue based on 3-day predictors with 85% accuracy after extensive hyperparameter tuning
- Trained and onboarded 10+ new resources on 4 accounts across South America and Europe
- Assigned additional responsibilities as a developer for Afinitiâ€™s custom R-based modelling tool used companywide
    - New training and validation methodologies were incorporated into the pipeline, improving validation accuracy by 10%
- Used Timeseries Analysis to predict the impact of football matches on caller behavior, model validations boosted by 2%

**Data Scientist I @ Afiniti (_March 2020 - January 2022_)**
- Optimized agent/caller interactions in call centers using MCMC Stan models and decision trees, resulting in a 5% increase in client revenue across multiple accounts
- Designed interactive Superset/Shiny dashboards to track important KPIs and monitor the real-time application of models, ensuring less than 1% revenue leakage
- Engineered modeling features using CRM and third-party data sources. Model validations improved by 3%
- Developed a multistep join logic in PostgreSQL/MySQL for outcomes and call feeds in collaboration with the client teams
    - Outcomes to Call attribution rate improved by 8% while processing time was reduced by 40%

## Projects
### Sales Maturity Forecasting Pipeline
**Domain: Predictive Analytics**\
**Tech Stack: Python, R, PostgreSQL, RMarkdown, Plotly**
- Developed a sales maturity forecasting pipeline to predict the likelihood of reversal of sales/cancellations within 30 days in a callcenter
- Implemented tree-based (LGBM, XGBoost) regression models in python using a telco callcenters calls, outcome and CRM data
- Created new customer history features to capture trends related to reversal of an outcome
- Model predicted a reversal with 90% accuracy
- Used Airflow DAGs to deploy the model into production
- Generated a daily RMarkdown report to evaluate model accuracy
    - Included interactive charts and visualizations for stakeholder insights
